public class Communication {
    private String contactType; // Type of communication (Email, Phone, Fax)
    private String contact;
    // Constructor to set contact type and value
    public Communication(String type, String cont) {
        this.contactType = type;
        this.contact = cont;
        if (!valid(type, cont)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Bad contact: " + type);
        }
    }
    // Validates the provided contact based on its type
    private boolean valid(String type, String contact) {
        if (type.toLowerCase().equals("email")) {
            return contact.matches("[w.-]+@[w.-]+.w{2,}");
        } else if (type.equals("phone") || type.equals("fax")) {
            return contact.matches("+?[0-9- ]{7,15}");
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    // Returns string representation of the Communication object
    public String toString() {
        return "Comm{" + "type:" + contactType + ", contact:" + contact + "}";
    }
}
```
**Documentation Summary:**
- This file defines a `Communication` class, which encapsulates the logic for handling communication types like Email, Phone, and Fax.
- It includes validation for the inputs and and provides an informative string representation of the communication objects.

    public String toString() {
        return "Address{ id:" + partyAddressId + ", type:" + addressType + ", line1:" + addressLine1 +
                ", line2:" + addressLine2 + ", city:" + city + ", state:" + state + ", country:" + country +
                ", postal:" + postalCode + "}";
    }
}
```
**Documentation Summary:**
- This file outlines the `Address` class, responsible for storing address components along with a unique identifier for each address.
- It provides a representation function for easy logging.
### 2. Inter-file Relationships and Dependencies
- `Main.java` interacts with the `Party`, `Address`, and `Communication` classes, instantiating these objects and invoking their methods.
- `Party` aggregates multiple addresses and communications but lacks the methods to manage those collections.
- All classes are defined in the same package ("model"), thus maintaining a consistent namespace.
### 3. Overall Architecture and Design Patterns
- The design follows a basic Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where the `Main.java` file acts as a Controller instantiating models (`Party`, `Address`, `Communication`).
- However, the architecture lacks a formal separation of concerns, where the `Main` class directly handles object creation and printing.
### 4. Security Considerations Across the Codebase
- Input validation exists for the contact information in `Communication`, but it should extend to other classes like `Party` and `Address` to ensure all fields are validated.
- Exception handling is limited, with potential opportunities for more robust error management practices.
- There is no logging mechanism, which limits tracking of application behavior in case of errors.
### 5. Performance Implications of the Design
- Memory consumption could become an issue if multiple instances of `Party`, `Communication`, or `Address` are created without proper disposal or reuse logic implemented.
- The use of `StringBuilder` in `Party` is an enhancement over basic string concatenation. However, this is not consistently applied across objects.
For brevity, I will only include the cited files in their documented format as shown above.
