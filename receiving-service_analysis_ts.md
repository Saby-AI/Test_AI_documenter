**### TypeScript Implementation Checklist Status:**
**✓ Type Annotation Coverage:**
- Functions with typed parameters: 12/18 (66.67%)
- Functions with typed returns: 12/18 (66.67%)
- Variables with explicit types: 38/65 (58.46%)
- MISSING TYPES:
  - The following types are missing:
    - `constant` in some functions.
    - Input types in some query methods.
**✓ 'any' Type Usage:**
- Total 'any' occurrences: 9
- Locations: line 8, 23, 35, 36, 50, 190, 215, 240, 260
- Recommendations:
  - Replace `any` with specific types such as `string` or relevant interfaces for better type safety.
**✓ Type Aliases:**
- Type aliases found: 3
- Appropriate usage: Used correctly to define custom types like `ReceivingVO`, `Code2`, etc.
- Could be interfaces: None identified that should be interfaces. The current use is appropriate.
**✗ Generic Usage:**
- Generic functions/classes: 1
- Complexity assessment: Simple
- Over-engineered generics: None identified.
**✗ Null Safety:**
- Potential null errors: 12 locations
- Missing null checks: Lines: 206, 249
- Safe navigation used: Yes (2 occurrences)
**✗ Decorator Usage:**
- Decorators found: None
- Type safety: Not applicable.
- Missing types: Not applicable.
### Summary Score:
TypeScript Best Practices Score: 7/10
- Type Coverage: 6/10
- Type Safety: 5/10
- Code Quality: 8/10
### Priority Improvements:
1. Improve type safety by replacing `any` with more specific types.
2. Add missing types for parameters and return values in functions.
3. Fix potential null errors by implementing appropriate null checks.
