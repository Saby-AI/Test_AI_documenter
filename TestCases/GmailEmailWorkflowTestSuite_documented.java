/*******************************************************************************
 * Class: GmailEmailWorkflowTestSuite
 * Description: This class is a JUnit test suite for testing the Gmail email workflow.
 * It includes methods for setting up the test environment, executing a test case to verify the
 * functionality of composing and sending an email, and tearing down the test environment after
 * the test is completed.
 *
 * Methods:
 * - setUp(): Initializes the GmailEmailWorkflowTest before each test.
 * - testGmailEmailWorkflow(): Tests the process of logging in, composing, saving a draft,
 *   and sending an email.
 * - tearDown(): Cleans up the test environment after each test.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - GmailEmailWorkflowTest: The main class containing email workflow methods.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * - The test case utilizes valid email and password from system properties to log into Gmail,
 *   compose an email, save it as a draft, verify the draft, and send the email.
