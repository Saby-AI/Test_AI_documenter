# Comprehensive Project Analysis - Party Management System
## Executive Summary
This comprehensive analysis covers the entire Party Management System repository, including `Main.java` and all its dependent files (`Party.java`, `Address.java`, and `Communication.java`). The system is designed to manage customer and vendor information with their associated addresses and communication details.
### Overall Assessment
**Code Quality Score: 6/10**
- **Strengths**: Clean object-oriented design, basic encapsulation, clear business domain modeling
- **Weaknesses**: Poor input validation, lack of documentation, security vulnerabilities, coding standard violations
**Risk Level: Medium-High**
- Critical security gaps requiring immediate attention
- Maintenance challenges due to poor documentation
- Potential runtime failures from inadequate error handling
## Project Architecture Overview
### System Components
1. **Main.java** - Entry point and demonstration of the system
2. **Party.java** - Core entity representing customers and vendors
3. **Address.java** - Address management with unique identification
4. **Communication.java** - Contact information with validation
### Architectural Patterns
- **Domain Model Pattern**: Classes represent business entities
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Basic encapsulation and abstraction
- **No Framework Usage**: Pure Java implementation
### Inter-Component Dependencies
