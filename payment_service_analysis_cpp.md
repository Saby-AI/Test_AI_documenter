  2. Utilize a JSON library for payload formatting (estimate: 2 weeks).
  3. Activate authorization handling for API requests (estimate: 1 week).
  4. Conduct security assessments against OWASP criteria (estimate: ongoing).
- **Implementation Roadmap:**
  - **Phase 1:** Refactor existing code (3-week timeframe).
  - **Phase 2:** Hardening security and performance (2-week timeframe).
  - **Phase 3:** Continuous integration of security measures (ongoing).
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Employ feature toggles for experimental features to ensure stability.
- **Resource Requirements:** Potential need for a security expert and a project manager for a thorough review.
- **Success Metrics:**
  - Reduction in bug reports post-deployment.
  - Improved response times of API calls.
